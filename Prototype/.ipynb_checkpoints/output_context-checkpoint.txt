  "test_case": "not_discoverable", 
  "test_description": "Test case fails due to Bluetooth device not being discoverable.", 
  "classification": "Setup issues", 
  "reasoning": "The log indicates a timeout error while waiting for a response to a start discovery management request, suggesting a possible setup or environment issue preventing the Bluetooth device from responding as expected."

  "test_case": "advertising",
  "test_description": "Testing Bluetooth advertising during the test suite",
  "classification": "Product issue",
  "reasoning": "The log contains an error indicating a BluetoothTimeoutError which suggests a failure to get a response for starting a discovery management request. This seems to be related to the Bluetooth functionality itself rather than the test script or setup."

  "test_suite": "BasicTests",
  "test_case": "pairing_mode",
  "test_description": "This test case tests the Bluetooth LE pairing functionality.",
  "classification": "Setup issues",
  "reasoning": "The log shows repeated '404 Not Found' errors for HTTP requests to the pairing URL, indicating that the test setup could not find the necessary resources for pairing. This suggests a possible misconfiguration or missing resources in the test environment."

  "test_case": "le_gap_local_name_write",
  "test_description": "The test involves writing the local name over a Bluetooth connection.",
  "classification": "Setup issues",
  "reasoning": "The log indicates that the test was skipped because the DUT width is not compatible with the test design. Specifically, the DUT width is 2.25 inches, but the test is designed for 4-inch printers. This issue is related to the test setup rather than the test script or the product itself."

  "test_description": "The test checks the local name setting functionality on the ZSB P12E printer.",
  "classification": "Setup issues",
  "reasoning": "The log entry indicates that the test was skipped due to an assertion failure because the DUT width is not compatible (2.25 inches while the test was designed for 4-inch printers). Additionally, there were multiple failed attempts to connect to the Weblink server, indicating setup or configuration issues."

  "classification": "Setup issues",
  "reasoning": "The test failed to establish a connection after several attempts with the error '[Errno 111] No matching connections found'. This suggests issues related to the test setup, such as incorrect device configurations or network-related issues, preventing proper communication with the device."
