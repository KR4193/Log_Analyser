  "test_description": "This test case aims to verify that the Classic Bluetooth device is not discoverable.",
  "classification": "Setup issues",
  "reasoning": "The logs indicate a timeout when waiting for a response to the discovery management request, followed by multiple attempts to start a Bluetooth session that failed due to the inability to discover the RFCOMM channel. This suggests a possible issue with the test environment such as network or Bluetooth connectivity problems, rather than a defect in the product or the ATF script itself."
