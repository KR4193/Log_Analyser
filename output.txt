### Analysis and Classification of Logs

#### Suite: CleanCutter
**Result:** failed

##### Module: CleanCutter_BasicTests

###### Failed Test Cases:
1. **Test Name:** clean_cutter_hqes
   - **Failure Category:** Setup issue
   - **Assertion Failure Message:** Clean cutter warning cleared return 8192, expected 0.

2. **Test Name:** cleancutter_crc_alert
   - **Failure Category:** Product issues
   - **Assertion Failure Message:** Normal validation failure encountered via assertion exception.
   
3. **Test Name:** cleancutter_print
   - **Failure Category:** Product issues
   - **Assertion Failure Message:** Normal validation failure encountered via assertion exception.
   
4. **Test Name:** cleancutter_ui
   - **Failure Category:** Product issues
   - **Assertion Failure Message:** Normal validation failure encountered via assertion exception.

**Possible Fixes for Suite CleanCutter:**
- Investigate setup issue with test `clean_cutter_hqes`, focus on why the warning return value is 8192 instead of the expected 0.
- Review the product features or hardware involved in test cases `cleancutter_crc_alert`, `cleancutter_print`, and `cleancutter_ui` to address the normal validation failures occurring due to assertion exceptions.

#### Suite: SnmpCleanCutterTests
**Result:** passed

### Summary:
- The relevant issue lies in the `CleanCutter` test suite.
- The SnmpCleanCutterTests and CutterDetectTests suites passed all their respective test cases.
- The ErrorCutterTests suite was skipped, with no errors reported.

### Detailed Analysis Suggestion:
- For the failed suite `CleanCutter`, an in-depth analysis and investigation are required for the setup issue in `clean_cutter_hqes` and the product issues in `cleancutter_crc_alert`, `cleancutter_print`, and `cleancutter_ui`.
- Consider focusing on setup connections and hardware attributes related to the cutter features for more precise diagnostics.
